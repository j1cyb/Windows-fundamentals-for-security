# Windows Security Fundamentals

This repository contains my learning notes and practical understanding of Windows fundamentals from a defensive (Blue Team) security perspective.

The goal of this project is to build a strong foundation in Windows internals by understanding how attackers abuse built-in components and how defenders can detect, investigate, and respond to such activity.

## Why this repository?
- Build a solid Windows security foundation
- Understand attacker behavior on Windows systems
- Develop a Blue Team / SOC analyst mindset
- Bridge the gap between theory and real-world detection

## Repository Structure
- Windows Basics  
  Covers core Windows tools and components that are commonly abused by attackers and monitored by defenders.

- Windows Concepts  
  Focuses on deeper system concepts that are important for persistence, detection, and forensic analysis.

## Notes Approach
Each topic is documented with a defensive mindset and focuses on:
- What the component or tool is
- How it is abused by attackers
- Why it matters for defenders
- Detection and security considerations

## Intended Audience
- Students learning Blue Team fundamentals
- Junior SOC analysts
- Anyone building practical Windows security knowledge

## Disclaimer
These notes are for educational purposes and focus on defensive security concepts.
